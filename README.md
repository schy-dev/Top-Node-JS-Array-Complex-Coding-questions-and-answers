Hereâ€™s a list of 10 complex array-related questions in Node.js, designed to challenge and improve your understanding of array manipulation, higher-order functions, and algorithmic thinking:

### 1. Nested Array Flattening
Write a function that flattens a deeply nested array into a single-level array. For example:
```javascript
flatten([1, [2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]]) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 2. Array Permutations
Given an array of distinct integers, write a function to return all possible permutations of the array elements. For example:
```javascript
permute([1, 2, 3]) // Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
```

### 3. Grouping Anagrams
Given an array of strings, write a function that groups anagrams together. For example:
```javascript
groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"])
// Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

### 4. Merge Intervals
Write a function to merge overlapping intervals from a list of intervals. For example:
```javascript
merge([[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]) // Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

### 5. Largest Subarray with Sum Zero
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the largest subarray with a sum of zero. For example:
```javascript
findLargestSubarray([1, 2, -3, 4, -2, 2, 1, -4, 3]) // Output: [2, -3, 4, -2, 2, 1]
```

### 6. Rotate Matrix (2D Array)
Given a 2D array (matrix), write a function to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. For example:
```javascript
rotateMatrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) 
// Output: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]
```

### 7. Array to Binary Search Tree
Write a function that converts a sorted array to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). For example:
```javascript
sortedArrayToBST([-10, -3, 0, 5, 9])
// Output: [0, -3, 9, -10, null, 5] (A BST structure)
```

### 8. Maximum Product Subarray
Given an integer array, write a function to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest product. For example:
```javascript
maxProduct([2,3,-2,4]) // Output: 6
```

### 9. Implement LRU Cache
Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using arrays and objects. The cache should have `get` and `put` methods with O(1) time complexity.

### 10. Find All Subsequences
Write a function that returns all subsequences of a given array. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements of the array without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example:
```javascript
findSubsequences([1, 2, 3]) 
// Output: [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

These questions cover a range of difficulties and require a strong understanding of array methods, recursion, and algorithm design in Node.js.
