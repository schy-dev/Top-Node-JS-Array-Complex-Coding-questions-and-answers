### Explanation of Merging Overlapping Intervals

#### Problem Statement:
Given a list of intervals where each interval is represented as a pair `[start, end]`, the goal is to merge all overlapping intervals into one. An interval `[a, b]` overlaps with another interval `[c, d]` if `a <= d` and `b >= c`. 

For example:
```javascript
merge([[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]])
// Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

#### Approach:
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals**:
   - Start by sorting the intervals based on the starting time. Sorting helps in identifying and merging overlapping intervals more efficiently.
   
2. **Iterate and Merge**:
   - Initialize an empty array to hold the merged intervals.
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals:
     - If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in the merged list (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the last interval), merge them by updating the end of the last interval.
     - If the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the merged list, simply add it to the merged list.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no intervals, the result is an empty list.
   - If there is only one interval, it doesn't need to be merged.

#### Code Implementation:
Here’s the code implementation:

```javascript
function merge(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return [];

  // Step 1: Sort intervals by their start time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  // Step 2: Initialize merged array with the first interval
  const merged = [intervals[0]];

  // Step 3: Iterate through each interval and merge if necessary
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const current = intervals[i];
    const lastMerged = merged[merged.length - 1];

    if (current[0] <= lastMerged[1]) {
      // Overlapping intervals, merge them
      lastMerged[1] = Math.max(lastMerged[1], current[1]);
    } else {
      // Non-overlapping interval, just add it to the merged array
      merged.push(current);
    }
  }

  return merged;
}

// Example
console.log(merge([[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]));
// Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

Let’s break down how the code works with the input `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`:

1. **Initial Sorting**:
   - The intervals are initially `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`.
   - We sort them based on the start time, but in this case, they are already sorted, so the order remains the same.

2. **Initialize the Merged List**:
   - We start with the first interval `[1, 3]` as our initial merged interval.

3. **Iterating Through the Intervals**:
   - **Interval `[2, 6]`**:
     - The start time `2` is less than or equal to the end time of the last merged interval `[1, 3]` (which is `3`), so they overlap.
     - We merge them by updating the end time of the last merged interval to the maximum of `3` and `6`, resulting in `[1, 6]`.
   - **Interval `[8, 10]`**:
     - The start time `8` is greater than the end time of the last merged interval `[1, 6]` (which is `6`), so they do not overlap.
     - We add `[8, 10]` to the merged list.
   - **Interval `[15, 18]`**:
     - The start time `15` is greater than the end time of the last merged interval `[8, 10]` (which is `10`), so they do not overlap.
     - We add `[15, 18]` to the merged list.

4. **Final Merged List**:
   - The merged intervals are `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`.

#### Final Output:
```javascript
console.log(merge([[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]));
// Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

### Key Points:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the intervals by their start time is crucial for merging them efficiently.
- **Merging Logic**: The logic to merge involves checking if the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the last merged interval. If they overlap, we merge by extending the end of the last merged interval.
- **Efficiency**: The time complexity of this approach is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step, followed by a linear `O(n)` pass to merge the intervals. This makes it efficient for practical purposes.

### Example Walkthrough:

- For the input `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`:
  - `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1, 6]`.
  - `[8, 10]` does not overlap with the previous merged interval, so it is added as-is.
  - `[15, 18]` does not overlap with `[8, 10]`, so it is also added as-is.

This approach ensures that all overlapping intervals are merged, while non-overlapping intervals remain separate.
