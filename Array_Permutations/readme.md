### Explanation of Array Permutations

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array, the goal is to generate all possible permutations (different orderings) of its elements. A permutation of an array is a rearrangement of its elements into a new sequence.

For example:
```javascript
permute([1, 2, 3]);
// Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
```

#### Approach:
To solve this problem, we use recursion, which is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems. Here’s how the approach works:

1. **Recursion**:
   - The idea is to fix one element and then find all permutations of the remaining elements. 
   - For example, to generate permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`, you can:
     - Fix `1` and find permutations of `[2, 3]`.
     - Fix `2` and find permutations of `[1, 3]`.
     - Fix `3` and find permutations of `[1, 2]`.
   - This process is repeated recursively for the sub-arrays until the base case is reached.

2. **Base Case**:
   - The base case for the recursion is when the input array is empty. In this case, there's only one permutation: an empty array.

3. **Recursive Step**:
   - For each element in the array, the function selects the element as the "fixed" element, and then recursively finds all permutations of the rest of the elements.
   - The results are combined by placing the "fixed" element at the start of each permutation of the remaining elements.

#### Code Implementation:
Here’s the code implementation:

```javascript
function permute(arr) {
  // Base case: if the array is empty, return an array with an empty array
  if (arr.length === 0) return [[]];
  
  const result = [];
  
  // Iterate through each element in the array
  arr.forEach((element, index) => {
    // Extract the element at the current index and the rest of the array
    const rest = arr.slice(0, index).concat(arr.slice(index + 1));
    
    // Recursively find permutations of the rest of the array
    const perms = permute(rest);
    
    // Add the current element to the start of each permutation
    perms.forEach((perm) => {
      result.push([element].concat(perm));
    });
  });
  
  return result;
}

// Example
console.log(permute([1, 2, 3])); 
// Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

Let's break down how the code works with the input `[1, 2, 3]`:

1. **Initial Call:**
   - `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
   - We start by fixing the first element, `1`, and finding permutations of the remaining array `[2, 3]`.

2. **Recursive Call 1 (with `[2, 3]`):**
   - Fix `2` and find permutations of `[3]`:
     - Since `[3]` has only one element, its only permutation is `[3]`.
     - Combine `2` with `[3]` to get `[2, 3]`.
   - Fix `3` and find permutations of `[2]`:
     - Since `[2]` has only one element, its only permutation is `[2]`.
     - Combine `3` with `[2]` to get `[3, 2]`.
   - The permutations of `[2, 3]` are `[2, 3]` and `[3, 2]`.

3. **Return to Initial Call (with `1` fixed):**
   - Combine `1` with each permutation of `[2, 3]`:
     - `[1, 2, 3]`
     - `[1, 3, 2]`
   - Now, fix the second element, `2`, and find permutations of `[1, 3]`.

4. **Recursive Call 2 (with `[1, 3]`):**
   - Fix `1` and find permutations of `[3]`:
     - Combine `1` with `[3]` to get `[1, 3]`.
   - Fix `3` and find permutations of `[1]`:
     - Combine `3` with `[1]` to get `[3, 1]`.
   - The permutations of `[1, 3]` are `[1, 3]` and `[3, 1]`.

5. **Return to Initial Call (with `2` fixed):**
   - Combine `2` with each permutation of `[1, 3]`:
     - `[2, 1, 3]`
     - `[2, 3, 1]`
   - Finally, fix the third element, `3`, and find permutations of `[1, 2]`.

6. **Recursive Call 3 (with `[1, 2]`):**
   - Fix `1` and find permutations of `[2]`:
     - Combine `1` with `[2]` to get `[1, 2]`.
   - Fix `2` and find permutations of `[1]`:
     - Combine `2` with `[1]` to get `[2, 1]`.
   - The permutations of `[1, 2]` are `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]`.

7. **Return to Initial Call (with `3` fixed):**
   - Combine `3` with each permutation of `[1, 2]`:
     - `[3, 1, 2]`
     - `[3, 2, 1]`

#### Final Output:
- The final result is the combination of all the permutations generated in the recursive steps:
  - `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]`

This output includes all possible permutations of the array `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Key Points:
- **Recursion** is used to handle the smaller subproblems of generating permutations for subarrays.
- The **base case** ensures that the recursion terminates when the array is empty.
- The result is built up by fixing each element in turn and finding permutations of the remaining elements.
- This approach works efficiently for small arrays, but the number of permutations grows factorially with the size of the array, making it computationally expensive for larger arrays.
