### Explanation of Grouping Anagrams

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array of strings, the goal is to group the strings that are anagrams of each other together. Anagrams are words that, when rearranged, form another word. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams of each other.

For example:
```javascript
groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"])
// Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

#### Approach:
To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sorting to Identify Anagrams**:
   - The key insight is that two words are anagrams if, when sorted, they produce the same string. For example, sorting both "eat" and "tea" results in "aet".
   - We can use this sorted string as a key to group anagrams together.

2. **Using a Map**:
   - We'll use a JavaScript `Map` (or an object) to store groups of anagrams. The keys in the map will be the sorted strings, and the values will be arrays of words that are anagrams of each other.
   - For each word in the input array:
     - Sort the word to generate the key.
     - Add the word to the array corresponding to that key in the map.

3. **Extracting the Groups**:
   - Once all words have been processed, the map will contain arrays of anagrams. We can extract these arrays to get the final result.

#### Code Implementation:
Here’s the code implementation:

```javascript
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  
  strs.forEach(str => {
    // Sort the string to get the key
    const key = str.split('').sort().join('');
    
    // If the key is not already in the map, add it with an empty array
    if (!map.has(key)) {
      map.set(key, []);
    }
    
    // Add the current string to the corresponding array in the map
    map.get(key).push(str);
  });
  
  // Convert the map's values to an array and return
  return Array.from(map.values());
}

// Example
console.log(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]));
// Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

Let’s break down how the code works with the input `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`:

1. **Initialize the Map**:
   - We start by creating an empty `Map` object called `map`.

2. **Processing Each Word**:
   - For each word in the array:
     - **"eat"**: Sort it to get the key `"aet"`. Since `"aet"` is not in the map, add it with `["eat"]` as its value.
     - **"tea"**: Sort it to get the key `"aet"`. Add `"tea"` to the existing array `["eat"]` in the map.
     - **"tan"**: Sort it to get the key `"ant"`. Since `"ant"` is not in the map, add it with `["tan"]` as its value.
     - **"ate"**: Sort it to get the key `"aet"`. Add `"ate"` to the existing array `["eat", "tea"]` in the map.
     - **"nat"**: Sort it to get the key `"ant"`. Add `"nat"` to the existing array `["tan"]` in the map.
     - **"bat"**: Sort it to get the key `"abt"`. Since `"abt"` is not in the map, add it with `["bat"]` as its value.

3. **Final Map Contents**:
   - After processing all words, the map contains:
     - `"aet"`: `["eat", "tea", "ate"]`
     - `"ant"`: `["tan", "nat"]`
     - `"abt"`: `["bat"]`

4. **Extracting the Groups**:
   - We extract the values of the map (the arrays of anagrams) and convert them into an array. The result is:
     - `[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]`

#### Final Output:
```javascript
console.log(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]));
// Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

### Key Points:
- **Sorting as the Key**: Sorting each word provides a way to identify anagrams since anagrams will have the same sorted form.
- **Using a Map**: The map stores grouped anagrams efficiently, allowing us to collect and then extract the groups at the end.
- **Efficiency**: Sorting each word is `O(k log k)` (where `k` is the length of the word), and iterating through the list is `O(n)` (where `n` is the number of words). The overall time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`, making this approach efficient for moderately sized input.

### Example Walkthrough:

- For the input `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`:
  - `"eat", "tea", "ate"` are grouped together because they all sort to `"aet"`.
  - `"tan", "nat"` are grouped together because they sort to `"ant"`.
  - `"bat"` stands alone because it sorts to `"abt"`.

This method effectively groups all anagrams together based on their sorted forms.
